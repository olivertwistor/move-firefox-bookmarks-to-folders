# Tasks

In this document, we keep track of both a work breakdown structure and a network diagram.

## Work breakdown structure

| Task ID | Name                                                         | Priority | Depends upon |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| 1       | Configuration file with defaults and instructions.           | 1        |              |
| 2       | Read configuration file to JS.                               | 1        | 1            |
| 3       | Move bookmarks to folders based on the configuration file. Do that with a push of a button. | 1        | 2            |
| 4       | Add triggers that move new bookmarks automatically when they're added. | 2        | 3            |
